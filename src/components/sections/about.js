            My name is <label>Valentina Vlasenko</label> or simply <label>Faliang</label>. Iâ€™m a junior
            frontend software engineer & freelance web developer in
            Saint-Petersburg -- with roots in teaching chinese & chinese
            translating. I'm passionate about technology, art, chinese and
            basically everything that has an influence on this wonderful world.

            My occupation currently consists of a developing my own websites and
            studying frontend development. I find this balancing act to be super
            resourceful in terms my learning as a web developer, as well as for
            keeping up with the rapid expansion of developer tools, libraries,
            frameworks, etc.

            I began my journey in programming with the desire to create a Russian-Chinese dictionary that met my needs. While developing the dictionary with my partner, I realized that through programming, I could create useful tools for society. That's how my love for JavaScript began.
