            My name is Valentina Vlasenko or simply Faliang. Iâ€™m a junior
            frontend software engineer & freelance web developer in
            Saint-Petersburg -- with roots in teaching chinese & chinese
            translating. I'm passionate about art, technology, chinese and
            basically everything that has an influence on this wonderful world.
          </p>
          <p>
            My occupation currently consists of a developing my own websites and
            studying frontend development. I find this balancing act to be super
            resourceful in terms my learning as a web developer, as well as for
            keeping up with the rapid expansion of developer tools, libraries,
            frameworks, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            My freelance web development roots are in Wordpress & Shopify, of
            which I'm self taught. In 2017, I started at UCLA to broaden my
            knowledge of the Node.js ecosystem. Since then, I fell in love with
            & have been primarily using React & Redux in web applications. For
            static sites, I love using Gatsby for creating blazing fast,
            SEO-driven headless frontend user interfaces.
